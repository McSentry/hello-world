Hello World!
My name is Julian Duran, and I am 24 years old (soon to be 25 in the next 10 days from the day of this transmission). 
I like watching Anime, watching Netflix, playing video games, watching Baseball, Bike Riding, Hanging at Free Arcades, and with friends, Meditating, going to the gym, and coding in my freetime.
Outside of my Freetime, I am a current CS Major Student at UT Dallas, and a full-time warehouse associate at Amazon.
I currently have C++, Java, MIPS Assembly, and C++ in Linux/UNIX under my belt in terms of Programming knowledge.
